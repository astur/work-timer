#work-timer

Web-timer counting how much you work (or doing something else). Like sport timer for work.

Click "Start" when you begin to work and click "Stop" when you take break. You may also click "Reset" if you want. Perfectionists may edit or delete wrong intervals.

Web-timer is localStorage based, so no any server-side sync is there. And no complicated statistics, no history, no archive, no social functionality and no evil boss watching you. It's really easy thing, no rocket science.

Now it is __v0.1.0__ and "Just works".
